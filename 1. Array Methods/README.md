**********Array Methods - Real-Life Examples*****

1. Creation and Manipulation

    * Array.from()

        Question: Write a program to convert a string of digits into an array of numbers.

        Example: Convert '12345' into [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

    * Array.isArray()

        Question: Write a program that checks if a given value is an array or not.

        Example: Check if ['apple', 'banana'] and 42 are arrays.

    * Array.of()

        Question: Write a program to create an array of various data types, such as numbers, strings, and booleans, using Array.of().
        
        Example: Create [1, 'hello', true, 3.14].

2. Access and Iteration

    * forEach()

        Question: Write a program that prints each item in an array of student names.

        Example: Print each name in ['John', 'Jane', 'Jim'].

    * map()

        Question: Write a program that converts an array of temperatures in Celsius to Fahrenheit.

    * filter()

        Question: Write a program that filters out all the even numbers from an array of integers.

        Example: Filter [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to get [2, 4].

    * reduce()

        Question: Write a program that calculates the total cost of items in a shopping cart, given an array of prices.

        Example: Sum [19.99, 5.49, 12.99] to get 38.47.

    * find()

        Question: Write a program to find the first even number in an array of integers.

        Example: Find the first even number in [1, 3, 5, 6, 7].

    * some()

        Question: Write a program to check if any student in a class has passed an exam, given an array of boolean values representing pass/fail status.

        Example: Check if any false values exist in [true, false, true, true].

    * every()

        Question: Write a program to check if all elements in an array of ages are above 18.

        Example: Verify if [20, 25, 30, 15] are all adults.

3. Transformation and Sorting

    * sort()

        Question: Write a program that sorts a list of names in alphabetical order.

        Example: Sort ['Charlie', 'Alice', 'Bob'] to get ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'].

    * reverse()

        Question: Write a program that reverses the order of words in a sentence.

        Example: Reverse 'hello world this is a test' to get 'test a is this world hello'.


    * concat()

        Question: Write a program that merges two arrays of numbers.

        Example: Concatenate [1, 2, 3] and [4, 5, 6] to get [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].

    * slice()

        Question: Write a program that extracts a portion of a string into a new substring.

        Example: Slice 'JavaScript' to get 'Script' from index 4.


4. Searching and Positioning

    * indexOf()

        Question: Write a program to find the position of the first occurrence of a specific item in an array.

        Example: Find the index of 'apple' in ['orange', 'apple', 'banana'].

    * lastIndexOf()

        Question: Write a program to find the position of the last occurrence of a specific item in an array.

        Example: Find the last index of 'apple' in ['orange', 'apple', 'banana', 'apple'].

    * includes()

        Question: Write a program to check if a given value is present in an array of strings.

        Example: Check if 'banana' is included in ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'].


5. Others

    * push()

        Question: Write a program to add a new item to the end of a shopping list array.

        Example: Push 'milk' into ['bread', 'eggs'].

    * pop()

        Question: Write a program that removes and returns the last item from a stack of plates.

        Example: Remove the last item from [1, 2, 3, 4].

    * shift()

        Question: Write a program to remove and return the first item from a queue of people waiting in line.

        Example: Remove the first person from ['John', 'Jane', 'Jim'].

    * unshift()

        Question: Write a program to add a new item to the beginning of a list of tasks.

        Example: Add 'Complete report' to ['Email client', 'Prepare presentation'].
